======

Using example app to build it out. The framework is not extracted yet.

The actual application lives here: public/javascripts/src/app 

TODO:
- Add more features to blog like creating posts. Use this to build out the jquery replacement.
- registering a function, sending a message, and getting a result works if the function is on the UI thread, but not if you spawn the function on a worker. (real close though)
- Work on support libraries so there are no globals: https://github.com/loop-recur/fpjsideas
